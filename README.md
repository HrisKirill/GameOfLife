## Conway's Game of Life

1. Implemented cellular automaton - game "Life".
2. The input file contains the dimensions of the field, the number of simulation iterations, and a two-dimensional array
   of "X" and "O" characters specifying which cells are alive at the start of the simulation.
   The program performs the specified number of simulation steps and outputs the received field to a new file.
3. The program is stuck. When the border of the field is reached, the cell on the opposite side is considered a
   neighbor.
